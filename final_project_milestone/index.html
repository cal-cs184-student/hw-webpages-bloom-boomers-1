		<h2>Summary</h2>

		As we work towards our final goal of not only accurately simulating fluid physics, but also rendering 
		it, we split this project into 2 parts: physics and rendering. Our goal for the milestone was finishing 
		as much as possible the physics of the fluid. To be more precise, that meant implementing fundamental 
		data structures such as the Fluid and the Particles that make up the fluid, representing the particles as 
		simple spheres, and allowing particles to bounce off boundaries and influence nearby particles (repeling
		close ones, while attracting others that are further away). Although we accomplished that goal, there is 
		still improvements that can be made to the physics of the particles.

		<h2>Preliminary Results</h2>

		As of now we are able to simulate fluids with about 1000 particles without siginificant FPS drops. We start 
		seeing FPS drops at around 1500 particles. The particles themselves also bounce off of boundaries, and hold some 
		influence to one another. We are also able to modify the fluid's properties in real time through the GUI, which 
		was initially a target deliverable. 
		
		<h2>Reflection</h2>

		Although there is room for improvement, we are quite satisfied with our progress, considering our group had a 
		last minute change of project proposal. Moving forward, we aim to tweak the physics in order to achieve better 
		results, as well as explore optimization options to further improve performance. We are nonetheless on track to 
		delivering on our target goals.  
		
		<h2>Updated Schedule: </h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>04/21-04/28</td>
				<td>
					Tweak particle physics and implement Ray marching rendering. Particles should clump up together and look like a fluid together 
					(instead of a group of individual particles). Fluid doesn't need to reflect or refract light at this
					stage.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>04/28-05/04</td>
				<td>
					Implement refraction and reflection. Liquid should look convincing and correctly refract and reflect 
					light from the light source and from the environment. Build test scene that allows user to see how 
					light from the environment influences the fluid. Finish report and video demo, and make preparations for 
					the presentation.
