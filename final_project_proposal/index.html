		<h2>Summary</h2>

		We aim to write a real time fluid simulation built on top of the Homework 4 structure. Our goal is 
		to also write our own rendering engine.

		<br>

		<h2>Problem Description</h2>

		Fluid simulation is a prevalent topic in computer graphics. The accurate depiction of liquids holds value in 
		entertainment, education, simulations, and other fields. Its implementation, however, is a challenging one. 
		Realistically simulating fluids is computationally expensive, primarily due to the sheer number of particles and
		calculations that need to be accounted for to make up a beliavable fluid. Although 
		<a href="https://yidingjiang.github.io/cs184sp18_final/">past projects</a> have circumvented this issue by allocating
		the rendering of the fluid to external rendering engines such as Blender, our project aims to implement our own 
		rendering engine.
		<br>
		<br>
		As previously mentioned fluid simulation computations are expensive, thus we must apply algorithms that are not only
		going to optimize calculations, but also do so in a GPU friendly manner since the GPU will handle most of the shading.
		One of the algorithms we can implement to ensure a smooth simulation is making use of a 3D grid and grouping particles by
		hashing them by their respective grid cell, much like what we did in part 4 of homework 4. This algorithm is explained
		in further detail <a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/particles.pdf">here</a>, but basically
		it allows us to cut down unnecessary calculations, while also providing the GPU with a fixed number of particles that 
		will be used in the shading part later on.
		<br>
		<br>
		To render liquids we will make use of the Ray Marching algorithm, more specifically Sphere Tracing, which is described
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp5WWtMoeKg">here</a>. Ray marching is a faster version of ray tracing,
		which will allow us to render complex reflections and refractions of the liquid in real time. 

		<h2>Goals and Deliverables: </h2>
		<h2>Minimum Viable Deliverables (for base grade):</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Realistic fluid physics (fluid holds itself together and bounces off of boundaries)
			</li>
			<li>
				Realistic fluid rendering (including reflection and refraction of light source and environment)
			</li>
			<li>
				Test scene that allows user to see reflection and refraction of environment
			</li>
			<li>
				Include a webpage report and flythrough demo video.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Target Deliverables (for full grade):</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				GUI that allows user to change fluid's properties, such as color, viscosity, and density in real time
			</li>
			<li>
				Fluid can interact with spheres and planes 
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Stretch Goals: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Add ocean foam to fluid 
			</li>
			<li>
				Interactive feature that allows user to scoop up liquid 
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Schedule: </h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Week</th>
				<th>Tasks</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>04/14-04/20</td>
				<td>
					Implement basic particle physics (particles correctly interact with boundaries and with each other).
					Simulation should not be to taxing for the GPU. Particles should have customizable color for 
					debugging purposes. 
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>04/21-04/28</td>
				<td>
					Implement Ray marching rendering. Particles should clump up together and look like a fluid together 
					(instead of a group of individual particles). Fluid doesn't need to reflect or refract light at this
					stage.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>04/28-05/04</td>
				<td>
					Implement refraction and reflection. Liquid should look convincing and correctly refract and reflect 
					light from the light source and from the environment. Build test scene that allows user to see how 
					light from the environment influences the fluid. Finish report and video demo, and make preparations for 
					the presentation.
				</td>
